        <p>Its been one year since you walked into my life, or I did, into yours? I'm glad I did, I wouldn't want it any different. Thank you for opening your heart for me and letting me stay even after everything I've done. Its the most comfortable place I've been in, I wouldn't wanna ever leave. At least, I'll try to give a reason to keep me there.
You treated me as a person, took interest in things I'm interested in, made my problems yours, made sure you're always here for me when I need you. Most of all, you valued my words, and might I say demands and made sure to fulfill all of them. I will eternally be grateful for everything. I thank Gods everyday for leading me to you.</p>
        <p>Since I've been with you, I've realized more and more that emotional intimacy is the highest of the intimacies; that I don't have to be around you to feel closer to you. Of course, not a day goes by without wishing for you to be in my arms and I, in yours. But I can live with this, I know we'll reach to a point where we can be in each others' arms and 'til then, I just have to hold on.</p>
        <p>I love you so much for so many reasons and for no reason at all. I love that you put efforts to understand me and my quirks; I love that you make me feel valued and wholesome, like I deserve to be loved; I love that you are patient with me even when I mess up horribly; I love that you try to take interest in my weirdest interests; I love the very existence of you!</p>
        <p>Thank you, babe, for not only putting up with me and my shits, but also for showering me with so much love and care. Its true, no one can ever love me like you do.
I wish I could make you half as happy as you make me.</p>
        <p>Happy first anniversary, baby! 
		I love you!</p>
        <p>~Your (kind of a shitty) superhero ♥️</p>
